#lang racket

;; A meta-circular evaluator defines a language by writing an interpreter
;; in an identical or similar language.

;; Here we're defining a language called VIS-Scheme
;; aka Virtual Infinity Systems Scheme aka VIS, which
;; (1) is similar to the original Scheme Language
;; (2) provides a model for understanding similar languages
;; (3) allows us to try out experimental extensions

;; We should keep our implementation details cleanly separated from our
;; semantic functions
;; - (vis-env . bindings)
;;   - creates an environment from 0 or more (key . value) pairs
;; - (vis-eval symbolic-expression environment)
;;   - evaluates an s-exp in a given env, yielding a value
;; - (vis-apply closure arguments)
;;   - applies a closure to an argument list, yielding a value

;; Compared to the first Scheme Standard, VIS currently lacks
;; - many Scheme functions - we can just borrow them from Racket!
;; - a macro defining system - and macro-definable special forms!
;; - reified continuations
;; - side effects (except for monotonic define in s-exp sequences)
;; VIS procedures are FUNCTIONAL, i.e. they compute a single value
;; from their arguments without any side-effects.
;; VIS programs are MONOTONIC, i.e. the top level environment will grow as
;; a side-effect of any top-level (define ...) special forms.

;; symbols evaluate to their value in the environment
;; lists evaluate as forms
;; everything else evaluates to itself

;; (define ...) forms don't return a regular value.  Since
;; Racket structures create a new type which is distinct from
;; all other types, they're perfect for this - otherwise we
;; would need to use, e.g. a tagged list.  And besides, Racket
;; (struct ...) writes our constructor, test and selector
;; functions for us - hurrah for metaprogramming!
;; So in our implementation define forms return a modified
;; environment (extended with the new binding) wrapped in a
;; structure, which is therefore NOT a VIS Scheme value!

;; Question and Exercise Problems:

;; - What is the cost of our implementation of environments?

;; - Create a repl for a nice top level
;;   - Make sure that it properly handles (define ...) forms
;; - Create an interactive repl
;; - Create a non-interactive repl for files and input streams
;;   - Should this be separate from the interative repl?
