* Lisp Systems

** Aspects of Lisp

I've had a long-term love affair with Lisp:
- Expressing myself in diverse and brilliant Lisp languages and dialects
  - especially the most elegant, consistent and general Lisps
- Exploring the programming techniques and paradigms that Lisp enables
  - functional programming, macro programming, metaprogramming
- Using the powerful programming tools available for a homoiconic language
- Studying the fascinating aspects of Lisp implementation:
  - representation, interpretation, compilation and runtime system support
- and all other aspects of Lisp

** Lisps vs. Other Languages

Lisp was originally inspired by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus][Lambda Calculus]] introduced by Alonzo Church
in the 1930s. Lisp systems have always been an attempt to harness the elegance
of the mathematical theory of computing along with ad hoc features that seemed
like helpful additions for practical programming. As the understanding of Lisp
systems has matured, newer Lisp systems have been able to discard a lot of those
ad hoc additions and much of the complexity of earlier Lisp systems by a better
realization of its formative principles, yielding an improvement in both
expressivity and efficiency.

Lisp is /not/ the only family of languages which have this kind of elegance and
this closeness to mathematics. The pure Functional Programming langauges such as
Haskell and the rest of the ML family have it. The Logic Programming languages,
including the Prolog family, Mercury and Curry have it. Mercury and most Prolog
systems also share Lisp's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity][homoiconicity]].

And some of the most wonderful programming languages either do not have quite as
much expressivity as Lisp or as much mathematical purity yet have great riches
to teach the explorer. 

Some awesome mathematically-based languages which I do not
find as generally expressive as Lisp include the Iverson language family of Apl,
J and K.

Some awesome languages which are perhaps less pures and more ad hoc than modern
Lisps include the Smalltalk family and the Forth family.

All of these languages are Turing complete, so you should be able to express any
algorithm in any one of them, but not always elegantly or "naturally". Many
powerful computational approaches would be more likely to occur to a programmer
when thinking in one language versus another one. Much (but not all) of this has
to do with how much a language is tied to specific [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm][Programming Paradigms]].
Languages which introduce you to new ways of thinking about computing increase
your programming power - which then becomes available to you in all other
languages, but especially in Lisp.

Lisp especially rewards the explorer because of Lisp's malleability. After
learning a new way of expressing computation in another language, it will
invariably be possible to use that new power of expression naturally in Lisp,
perhaps assisted by some choice macros! [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket]] takes this to an extreme by
allowing for the definition of new languages which can introduce radically new
features such as static typing and allowing you to express different parts of a
program in different languages!
